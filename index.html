<H1> My Experience With Color Guard</H1>

<H2> What Is It?</H2>

<p><b><button onclick="alert('Began in the USA in 1937')">Colorguard</button></b> is formally known as the visual representation for the marching band.  
Members of the guard use equipment - sabres, rifles, flags and other props - to add color, effects, drama and emotion to the music played by the band. 
By throwing and catching equipment, color guard is something that is also judged during competition.
The color guard world is very competitive which is why there is also a winter season where guards perform against other guards. 
During winter guard, guards perform with compiled and edited songs instead of music from the marching band. 
In order to be one of the best, it is important that each show is comprised of exciting themes, multiple tricks and surprises to excite the judges and audience. 
Throughout this website, I would like to take you on the journey of my experience in color guard. 
Each section will have a different element of guard that I experienced. </p>

<li><i> Saturdays are competition days. 
Usually Saturday practices would be early in the morning. 
After practicing we loaded our equipment on to a truck, did makeup and loaded the buses. Guard always has the most to do in preparation for a competition, because we have to do makeup and have all of our equipment togther.</i></li>
<li><i>Fridays are football games so the marching band and guard perform during halftime. 
We don't have a full practice because we have to get prepared for the game after school, but we would practice for about 30 minutes before we performed.</i></li>
<li><i>Believe it or not, clean-up usually took an hour max. Everyone had to take everything from the practice field up to the band room (which was a long walk up a hill). We then had to put all of our equipment up, clean the bandroom, and listen to any closing remarks from our band director, drum majors and/or captains before we were dismissed.</i></li>

<li><i>Because football season is over by time winter guard comes, guard will have long practices on Friday as well.</i></li>
<li><i> Competition days are much different from those with marching band. Guard only has to worry about their equipement and there is also less people traveling to and from competitions.</i></li>
<li><i>Usually we would wait until we got to the competition site before practicing. 
That way we could do our makeup and get ready to perform after we practiced.</i></li>
